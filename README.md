# Cube

__NOTE:__ This fork merges [this pull request](https://github.com/square/cube/pull/80) to support wildcards. It also incorporates [this pull request](https://github.com/square/cube/pull/86) to add in event subtype/namespacing.

**Cube** is a system for collecting timestamped events and deriving metrics. By collecting events rather than metrics, Cube lets you compute aggregate statistics *post hoc*. It also enables richer analysis, such as quantiles and histograms of arbitrary event sets. Cube is built on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) and available under the [Apache License](/square/cube/blob/master/LICENSE).
